# Problem
We want to create a python script that can open up a text file, and count the number of `1` characters in the file.

# Expected result
`python solution.py 1.txt` should output `190`
`python solution.py 2.txt` should output `99`
`python solution.py 3.txt` should output `133`
`python solution.py 4.txt` should output `150`
`python solution.py 5.txt` should output `152`
