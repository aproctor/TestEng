# Problem
We want to create a python script that can open up a text file, and tell us the number that has repeated the fewest number of times.

Each number is on it's own line and is an integer.

If two numbers have the same frequency count, return the smaller of the two numbers

# Expected result
`python solution.py 1.txt` should output `0 26 time(s)`

`python solution.py 2.txt` should output `1 20 time(s)`

`python solution.py 3.txt` should output `-23 1 time(s)`

`python solution.py 4.txt` should output `-48 1 time(s)`

`python solution.py 5.txt` should output `-40 1 time(s)`
